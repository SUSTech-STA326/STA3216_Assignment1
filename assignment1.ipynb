    "### Scraping Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1) If you are using another organization's website for scraping, make sure to check the website's terms & conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Do not request data from the website too aggressively (quickly) with your program (also known as spamming), as this may break the website. Make sure your program behaves in a reasonable manner (i.e. acts like a human). One request for one webpage per second is good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The layout of a website may change from time to time. Because of this, if you're scraping a website, make sure to revisit the site and rewrite your code as needed."

Before releasing this data, a data scientist cleaned the data to protect the privacy of Tinder's users by removing the obvious personal identifiers: phone #, zip code, and IP address.

It involves scrutinizing the data for inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and incompleteness. Techniques such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting errors are employed to refine the dataset. A common phenomenon is that the collected data may contain missing values. Here are two common ones:\n",

    "- **Nonresponse.** For example, people might have left a field blank when responding to a survey, or left the entire survey blank.\n",

In this particular dataset, however, the **missing values occur completely at random**. This criteria allows us to drop missing values without significantly affecting our conclusions.\n",
